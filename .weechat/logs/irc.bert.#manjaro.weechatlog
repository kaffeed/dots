2016-04-21 19:21:37	mtn	belmont: which one did you choose?
2016-04-21 19:21:37	belmont	mtn: maybe i shouldn't use meta
2016-04-21 19:21:37	mtn	belmont: meta is the best choice
2016-04-21 19:21:37	belmont	plasma does not start, second plasma is ok, media center also ok
2016-04-21 19:21:37	mtn	belmont: did you notice if anything was being removed when you did the install?
2016-04-21 19:21:37	belmont	perhaps first 'plasma' is on wayland ? 
2016-04-21 19:21:37	mtn	belmont: that is possible
2016-04-21 19:21:37	belmont	mtn: hard to say, is there a log for pacman?
2016-04-21 19:21:37	mtn	belmont: yes there is
2016-04-21 19:21:37	mtn	belmont: /var/log
2016-04-21 19:21:37	belmont	yup, checked it no removals
2016-04-21 19:21:37	mtn	belmont: make a new user, test using the new user
2016-04-21 19:21:37	belmont	mtn: good one, will also start a new session on xfce
2016-04-21 19:21:37	belmont	brb
2016-04-21 19:21:37	belmont	mtn: so, other user is perfectly fine - no issues
2016-04-21 19:21:37	belmont	mtn: some script must changed sth in cfg files in home dir
2016-04-21 19:21:37	mtn	belmont: ok, that means you have some problem in your xfce config folders/files in your normal user
2016-04-21 19:21:37	mtn	belmont: not related to kde/xfce conflict
2016-04-21 19:21:37	belmont	mtn: don't think so, it was fine before plasma-meta, any ideas what can couse issues with themes?
2016-04-21 19:21:37	mtn	belmont: it has to be a problem in the configs, since a new user with default configs works fine. no other expanation
2016-04-21 19:21:37	belmont	mtn: i'll try to copy .config/xfce4 to my home and check it out
2016-04-21 19:21:37	mtn	belmont: just rename your config folder. log out and back in.  a new one will be created
2016-04-21 19:21:37	belmont	mtn: did that no luck
2016-04-21 19:21:37	mtn	belmont: did what?
2016-04-21 19:21:37	belmont	mtn: rename .config/xfce4
2016-04-21 19:21:37	mtn	belmont: maybe there are more xfce folders? some des have 3 of them :P
2016-04-21 19:21:37	mtn	belmont: I would research resetting xfce configs to default
2016-04-21 19:21:37	belmont	mtn: ok, has to be home setting though ;) thanks
2016-04-21 19:21:37	mtn	belmont: welcome and good luck

2016-04-24 15:22:38	crutchy	i use my local isp dns as primary and google as secondary
2016-04-24 15:22:39	jnylen	crutchy, when you have a kid its 5 months of paid parental leave
2016-04-24 15:22:43	crutchy	seems to work pretty well
2016-04-24 15:22:51	akaseki	jnylen, for the longest time (even now), if forced, I will actually use their internal DNS server
2016-04-24 15:22:58	crutchy	jnylen, you say it like its a good thing
2016-04-24 15:23:05	jnylen	crutchy, it isnt?
2016-04-24 15:23:13	crutchy	someone's gotta pay for that mate
2016-04-24 15:23:30	akaseki	jnylen, also, when you use a VPN to connect to shit, even with leak protection on, it's best to not use your default
2016-04-24 15:23:32	akaseki	imho
2016-04-24 15:23:33	crutchy	its lost productivity
2016-04-24 15:23:57	crutchy	its welfare
2016-04-24 15:23:58	jnylen	akaseki, ovpn have a dns you can use
2016-04-24 15:24:03	jnylen	not sure if mullvad does
2016-04-24 15:25:20	crutchy	here we get a month of paid parental leave that's partially funded by government and partially by employer
2016-04-24 15:25:30	crutchy	that's heaps
2016-04-24 15:25:59	crutchy	after 5 months you become less employable
2016-04-24 15:26:58	jnylen	holy
2016-04-24 15:26:58	jnylen	shit
2016-04-24 15:27:06	jnylen	France has fucking amazing school food
2016-04-24 15:27:25	Animeconnoisseur	No.
2016-04-24 15:27:45	crutchy	it doesn't?
2016-04-24 15:27:52	Animeconnoisseur	it doesn't
2016-04-24 15:28:01	crutchy	france seems like it has amazing food
2016-04-24 15:28:13	crutchy	i never been there though
2016-04-24 15:28:30	Animeconnoisseur	it does, however the food they serve at school is horrible
2016-04-24 15:28:37	crutchy	oh
2016-04-24 15:28:39	akaseki	crutchy, the thing is that having no or very little leave for new parents is actually more damaging to the economy than having other tax payers front part of the bill for those poeple
2016-04-24 15:29:04	crutchy	akaseki, i don't think so
2016-04-24 15:29:05	akaseki	crutchy, as you quite well said, a longer period of time out of the workplace will make you less employable 
2016-04-24 15:29:11	beaky	btw is kiznavier a good anime
2016-04-24 15:29:57	crutchy	actually i thin ksome leave is important
2016-04-24 15:29:58	crutchy	yes
2016-04-24 15:30:02	crutchy	*think
2016-04-24 15:30:03	akaseki	crutchy, this means that in a system where your time off work is not realistic to the time-frame of the problem on hand (in this case, the needs of a new born and post-birth woman) to reach a satisfactory point
2016-04-24 15:30:17	akaseki	crutchy, you will likely either sacrifice one or the other or yourself
2016-04-24 15:30:27	crutchy	4 weeks leave is plenty
2016-04-24 15:30:32	crutchy	speaking from experience
2016-04-24 15:31:01	crutchy	actually i only had 2 weeks
2016-04-24 15:31:06	crutchy	and that was plenty
2016-04-24 15:31:08	akaseki	crutchy, this means you'll have to pick between: 1. Workplace abandonment of trained professionals; 2. A trained professional who is distracted and unfocused (i.e unproductive and error-prone)

2016-04-24 15:31:24	akaseki	crutchy, this is based on a house-hold where both parents work
2016-04-24 15:31:28	jnylen	looks fucking good to me m8
2016-04-24 15:31:41	jnylen	4 course meal
2016-04-24 15:31:43	crutchy	akaseki, lol dude the distraction doesn't stop after your parental leave finishes
2016-04-24 15:31:45	jnylen	dessert and shit
2016-04-24 15:31:51	akaseki	crutchy, and if you tell a woman she'll have to give birth and come back to work in 4 weeks, generally she's going to stab you in the eye and have you come back to work in 4 hours
2016-04-24 15:31:57	akaseki	crutchy, just to prove a point
2016-04-24 15:32:17	crutchy	akaseki, my wife doesn't work
2016-04-24 15:32:37	crutchy	but yes women should get a few weeks off to recover
2016-04-24 15:33:04	akaseki	crutchy, here maternal leave is up to 2 years (with slight decrease in pay - i.e 2 years you get about 75% pay)
2016-04-24 15:33:08	crutchy	if she needs more than 4 weeks there are options
2016-04-24 15:33:19	crutchy	2 years is just stupid
2016-04-24 15:33:23	akaseki	crutchy, paternal leave is generally up to a month
2016-04-24 15:33:26	crutchy	she might as well drop out of the workforce
2016-04-24 15:33:31	crutchy	after 2 years leave
2016-04-24 15:34:04	jnylen	akaseki, we only ahve 480 of paid parental leave
2016-04-24 15:34:08	crutchy	here we have a month paternity leave (came in after my last was born)
2016-04-24 15:34:16	crutchy	not sure of maternity leave
2016-04-24 15:34:24	akaseki	crutchy, and when she comes back, she won't be someone with multiple negatives (i.e has not worked for a while, has outdated information on her field, has small child at home) for a hiring company
2016-04-24 15:34:34	jnylen	For 390 of the days, parents are entitled to nearly 80 per cent of their normal pay. Benefits are calculated on a maximum monthly income of SEK 37,083, as of 2015. The remaining 90 days are paid at a flat rate. Those who are not in employment are also entitled to paid parental leave.
2016-04-24 15:34:43	akaseki	crutchy, she will come back to her old job where she will just need to be brought up to speed
2016-04-24 15:34:47	jnylen	Parental leave can be taken up until a child turns eight. The leave entitlement applies to each child (except in the case of multiple births), so parents can accumulate leave from several children.
2016-04-24 15:34:57	crutchy	akaseki, by then she will have been replaced
2016-04-24 15:34:59	akaseki	crutchy, sure, the employer will have her with reduced capacity, but with increased loyalty 
2016-04-24 15:35:01	jnylen	Outside the 480 paid days, parents in Sweden also have the legal right to reduce their normal working hours by up to 25 per cent until the child turns eight. 
2016-04-24 15:35:23	akaseki	crutchy, i.e these things exist to benefit everyone involved

2016-04-24 15:35:34	crutchy	akaseki, except those that gotta foot the bill
2016-04-24 15:35:41	akaseki	crutchy, having a simplistic system where if you can't be there you're at the whims of the employer is just moronic
2016-04-24 15:35:59	akaseki	crutchy, the bill is split here between the employer and state
2016-04-24 15:36:18	crutchy	if women cost more to employ than men, they are less likely to be employed than men
2016-04-24 15:36:21	crutchy	simple as that
2016-04-24 15:36:49	akaseki	this is changing the subject
2016-04-24 15:36:51	akaseki	also
2016-04-24 15:36:52	crutchy	women end up paying for it
2016-04-24 15:37:00	crutchy	no its on point
2016-04-24 15:37:10	crutchy	socialist policies always have unintended consequences
2016-04-24 15:37:17	akaseki	all the rules and regulations that also create things like maternity/paternity leave are there to protect emplyer and employee alike
2016-04-24 15:37:24	crutchy	that adversely affect those intended to be helped
2016-04-24 15:37:28	akaseki	oh 
2016-04-24 15:37:48	akaseki	so you mean that things an unregulated system doesn't/
2016-04-24 15:37:50	akaseki	?
2016-04-24 15:38:02	jnylen	akaseki, watch Where to invade next
2016-04-24 15:38:11	crutchy	you introduce maternity leave thats supposed to help women, and women end up being discriminated against in job selection
2016-04-24 15:38:16	akaseki	or like the usa has, a system that is meant to protect mainly the company
2016-04-24 15:38:38	akaseki	jnylen, meh, 2nd word war, right?
2016-04-24 15:38:45	crutchy	if you force employers to pay more for women (for the benefit of women), they will be less likely to be employed (hurting those same women)
2016-04-24 15:38:57	akaseki	crutchy, how do they pay more?
2016-04-24 15:39:05	crutchy	maternity leave
2016-04-24 15:39:10	akaseki	that's not paying more
2016-04-24 15:39:17	crutchy	how is it not?
2016-04-24 15:39:21	akaseki	that's actually paying less 
2016-04-24 15:39:24	crutchy	lol
2016-04-24 15:39:34	akaseki	and gaining tax-breaks from the state
2016-04-24 15:39:34	crutchy	does the state pay?
2016-04-24 15:39:40	crutchy	hahaha
2016-04-24 15:39:49	jnylen	akaseki, USA and Finland was at the same bottom in 1960
2016-04-24 15:39:53	jnylen	in Education
2016-04-24 15:39:55	crutchy	you gotta make money off someone to benefit from tax breaks dude

2016-04-24 15:40:28	akaseki	crutchy, the whole idea behind our conflict is this: I don't give a fuck about the employer or the employee, but both have to be protected from the other
2016-04-24 15:40:36	Urchin	jnylen: how?
2016-04-24 15:40:48	crutchy	akaseki, you just gotta allow competition
2016-04-24 15:40:51	jnylen	Urchin, watch the movie m8
2016-04-24 15:40:55	crutchy	the employee gotta have options
2016-04-24 15:41:03	Urchin	jnylen: what movie?
2016-04-24 15:41:04	crutchy	to be able to tell the employer to fuck off
2016-04-24 15:41:11	jnylen	Urchin, Where to invade next
2016-04-24 15:41:11	akaseki	crutchy, that's why the economy is regulated, to avoid companies fucking over the people working for them (see american system where the law allows employers a lot of freedom and they mostly choose to turn their employees into slaves)
2016-04-24 15:41:13	crutchy	otherwise it doesn't matter what you do
2016-04-24 15:41:34	jnylen	akaseki, they can also fire people that need parental leave
2016-04-24 15:41:39	crutchy	employment != slavery
2016-04-24 15:41:40	jnylen	Job security m8
2016-04-24 15:41:45	akaseki	crutchy, and to avoid the employees fucking over their employers by sabotaging the company effort or doing things like insider trading and so on
2016-04-24 15:41:47	beaky	what is employment
2016-04-24 15:42:08	crutchy	akaseki, that's fine in theory. unfortunately there are lots of unintended consequences
2016-04-24 15:42:23	akaseki	crutchy, it is slavery when you start with no rights and you have to bow your head and do as told regardless of yourself for the wage
2016-04-24 15:42:27	akaseki	crutchy, the term is "wage slave"
2016-04-24 15:42:31	crutchy	no its not
2016-04-24 15:42:43	crutchy	nobody forces anyone to work
2016-04-24 15:42:54	crutchy	only lazy people think they are slaves
2016-04-24 15:43:02	crutchy	stupid lazy people
2016-04-24 15:43:03	akaseki	crutchy, unintended consequences alway exist; but saying that not regulating shit because some consequences may appear you haven't thought of in the beginning is simply moronic
2016-04-24 15:43:22	akaseki	crutchy, then why don't we just say fuck it all and go back to using actual slaves
2016-04-24 15:43:27	crutchy	because that would be moronic
2016-04-24 15:43:39	akaseki	that's what you're pushing
2016-04-24 15:43:41	akaseki	for
2016-04-24 15:43:45	crutchy	no its not
2016-04-24 15:43:50	akaseki	yes 
2016-04-24 15:43:51	akaseki	it is
2016-04-24 15:44:13	crutchy	the only organisation that can actually enslave someone is government
2016-04-24 15:44:17	akaseki	morons who want a lot of regulation and morons (like you) who want less regulation are equally bad sides of the same shitty coin
2016-04-24 15:44:30	akaseki	crutchy, what century are you living in?
2016-04-24 15:44:34	crutchy	the ones that want less regulation are right though
2016-04-24 15:44:38	⚡	Urchin facepalms
2016-04-24 15:44:41	akaseki	sigh
2016-04-24 15:44:42	crutchy	the ones that want more are wrong
2016-04-24 15:45:04	akaseki	and then crutchy dies in a fire working in his multinational
2016-04-24 15:45:04	akaseki	and nobody gives a flying fuck
2016-04-24 15:45:10	crutchy	akaseki, i'm happy in my employment
2016-04-24 15:45:17	crutchy	that i choose to engage in
2016-04-24 15:45:29	akaseki	because that corporation is so powerful they can simply bribe a couple of govt. officials over the more dire consequences
2016-04-24 15:45:33	akaseki	and the rest is unregulated
2016-04-24 15:45:44	crutchy	you actually hit the nail on the head then
2016-04-24 15:45:47	crutchy	without even realising it

2016-04-24 15:46:07	Urchin	no meaningful work anyway
2016-04-24 15:46:09	akaseki	crutchy, yes, if you remove regulation you actually make it easier to reach abuse
2016-04-24 15:46:28	crutchy	if you remove regulation there's nothing to bribe govt. officials for

2016-04-24 15:46:46	crutchy	if you add regulations there's more bribery
2016-04-24 15:47:03	akaseki	crutchy, then you'd die in that fire and nobody will care at all
2016-04-24 15:47:10	akaseki	crutchy, because the law didn't regulate that
2016-04-24 15:47:15	crutchy	markets have always been the best regulators
2016-04-24 15:47:17	akaseki	your family will sue your employer and lose

2016-04-24 15:48:31	akaseki	crutchy, i think that if i had a multinational corporation i would use every trick in the book and slightly off interpretation to make some more money 
2016-04-24 15:48:53	crutchy	do you realise how multinational corporations get so big?
2016-04-24 15:48:59	akaseki	crutchy, in conclusion: no, less regulation will make nothing better, it will just give people more room to be cunts 
2016-04-24 15:49:27	akaseki	crutchy, part of the model is: find a country where activity isn't regulated or heavily taxed and work in that country
2016-04-24 15:49:33	crutchy	less regulation would improveeveryones lives dramatically
2016-04-24 15:49:39	akaseki	crutchy, if need be, destabilize a govt. that's weaker than us
2016-04-24 15:49:49	crutchy	government is important
2016-04-24 15:49:51	akaseki	crutchy, tell this to the cunts gathering diamonds for debeers
2016-04-24 15:50:00	jnylen	crutchy, oh yeah, Education should be free
2016-04-24 15:50:02	Animeconnoisseur	what if the government is the cunt?
2016-04-24 15:50:09	jnylen	University shouldn't fuck your life over
2016-04-24 15:50:09	akaseki	crutchy, or the cunts still dying now in latin america over chiquita's banana-money coup-d'etat
2016-04-24 15:50:21	crutchy	akaseki, you don't even know that its the governments of those african countries that are the cunts
2016-04-24 15:50:21	Animeconnoisseur	Education shouldn't be entirely free
2016-04-24 15:50:31	Animeconnoisseur	otherwise diplomas have no value whatsoever
2016-04-24 15:50:45	akaseki	crutchy, or the cunts in good old unregulated China jumping out of windows because Apple's literally working them to suicide
2016-04-24 15:50:55	crutchy	dude, china is heavily regulated
2016-04-24 15:50:58	crutchy	what are you smoking?
2016-04-24 15:51:18	akaseki	crutchy, please tell me while you sit there in your safety guaranteed by govt. regulation how less regulation is better
2016-04-24 15:51:32	crutchy	i already said that government sucks at regulating
2016-04-24 15:51:47	crutchy	it doesn't matter how many regulations you put in place
2016-04-24 15:51:54	akaseki	crutchy, the thing is that regulation is the only way to go that won't create problems
2016-04-24 15:51:55	Animeconnoisseur	France is pretty much communism at this point
2016-04-24 15:51:56	crutchy	they will be flouted by the big boys
2016-04-24 15:52:03	crutchy	that you try to protect the little guy from
2016-04-24 15:52:09	pyon	Animeconnoisseur: By what metric?
2016-04-24 15:52:11	crutchy	in fact, the big boys will probably write the regulations
2016-04-24 15:52:13	akaseki	crutchy, for example, it would be THE BEST SOLUTION to shoot the entire upper management of Apple in the head right now
2016-04-24 15:52:15	Animeconnoisseur	the govt handles most of the businesses
2016-04-24 15:52:23	crutchy	akaseki, why?
2016-04-24 15:52:28	akaseki	crutchy, and put all their assets under indirect govt. control
2016-04-24 15:52:29	crutchy	cos they gave us the iphone?
2016-04-24 15:52:31	Animeconnoisseur	and they make it as hard as they can if you dare create one
2016-04-24 15:52:37	crutchy	akaseki, that would drive apple broke

2016-04-24 15:52:56	akaseki	but let's assume they wouldn't go under
2016-04-24 15:52:58	pyon	Animeconnoisseur: That's a planned economy, but I don't see how it's necessarily communism.
2016-04-24 15:53:08	crutchy	lets assume fairies took over
2016-04-24 15:53:12	akaseki	what would happen is that the always narcissistic us govt will move part of production back
2016-04-24 15:53:36	akaseki	more jobs, more money and the us will be able to do even more dubious gray-market trading with asia
2016-04-24 15:53:39	crutchy	and the prices of apple products would skyrocket
2016-04-24 15:53:44	Animeconnoisseur	Iphones cost nothing to make

2016-04-24 15:54:08	akaseki	crutchy, nah, the govt. isn't that greedy, they would likely only see a 5-10% price increase
2016-04-24 15:54:17	crutchy	wages would go up
2016-04-24 15:54:20	crutchy	so the cost must go upo
2016-04-24 15:54:24	crutchy	*up
2016-04-24 15:54:25	akaseki	but with added production cost because of actually paying americans to make them phones
2016-04-24 15:54:29	pyon	akaseki: So, which is it - shareholders will be forced to give up on profits, or customers will be forced to pay higher prices for iPhones?
2016-04-24 15:54:31	crutchy	lol
2016-04-24 15:54:35	Animeconnoisseur	apple could make things in the US and keep the current overbloated prices
2016-04-24 15:54:37	Animeconnoisseur	I bet
2016-04-24 15:54:38	akaseki	mate, an iphone costs <$50 TO MAKE
2016-04-24 15:54:47	crutchy	cos the labor is cheap
2016-04-24 15:54:48	akaseki	my keyboard is dead
2016-04-24 15:54:58	akaseki	the caps lock is like.. turning on by itself
2016-04-24 15:55:01	Animeconnoisseur	$236?
2016-04-24 15:55:02	akaseki	COOL
2016-04-24 15:55:05	crutchy	if you move it to america, cost of labor will be much much higher
2016-04-24 15:55:06	Animeconnoisseur	that seems too much
2016-04-24 15:55:09	pyon	akaseki: An iPhone costs less than $50 to make *in China*.
2016-04-24 15:55:29	pyon	crutchy: In all fairness, labor costs don't dominate the production costs.
2016-04-24 15:55:30	Animeconnoisseur	are these the retail prices for customers or apple?
2016-04-24 15:55:37	crutchy	pyon, they do

2016-04-24 15:55:46	crutchy	what industry don't they?
2016-04-24 15:55:47	pyon	crutchy: Material costs, and other supply-chain related costs dominate.

2016-04-24 15:55:56	crutchy	lol in what industry?
2016-04-24 15:56:02	crutchy	do material costs dominate?
2016-04-24 15:56:40	crutchy	i guess *in china* that might be the case
2016-04-24 15:56:49	crutchy	in western countries not a chance
2016-04-24 15:56:53	pyon	crutchy: Guess where iPhones are made.
2016-04-24 15:56:58	crutchy	in china
2016-04-24 15:57:11	crutchy	in western countries labor is a huge cost
2016-04-24 15:57:22	crutchy	its why companies move their operations to china
2016-04-24 15:57:30	crutchy	other than red tape
2016-04-24 15:57:41	crutchy	that regulation stuff that akaseki loves so much
2016-04-24 15:58:12	pyon	crutchy: Well, truth be said, you wouldn't really like to be thrown in a place with no government regulation, no matter what you say now.

2016-04-24 15:58:22	crutchy	pyon, not saying *no regulation*
2016-04-24 15:58:28	crutchy	just *less regulation*

2016-04-24 15:59:04	crutchy	governments should not be involved in markets
2016-04-24 15:59:07	pyon	crutchy: Some markets *need* to be regulated. For example, telecommunications.
2016-04-24 15:59:13	crutchy	how so?

2016-04-24 15:59:31	crutchy	regulations in telecommunications have given rise to monopolies

2016-04-24 16:00:36	crutchy	big telcos are the ones that write regulations that make it harder for little telcos

2016-04-24 16:00:44	crutchy	through their lobbyists

2016-04-24 16:01:49	crutchy	african countries have had very corrupt governments and little economic freedom
2016-04-24 16:01:57	crutchy	kinda the opposite of what i've been advocating

2016-04-24 16:04:37	akaseki	crutchy, lack of regulation in telecom has given rise to monopolies you mean
2016-04-24 16:04:37	crutchy	so all the bad stuff
2016-04-24 16:04:47	crutchy	no, regulation makes monopilies

2016-04-24 16:05:05	crutchy	only governments can create monopolies
2016-04-24 16:05:11	akaseki	crutchy, you would think that, but less regulation makes it easier for the more powerful to fuck over the less
2016-04-24 16:05:13	crutchy	because only governments can use force
2016-04-24 16:05:29	crutchy	companies can't force people to buy shit
2016-04-24 16:05:30	akaseki	crutchy, that's why all muricans thing their internet is expensive shit (and they're right)
2016-04-24 16:05:45	crutchy	cos US telcos are among the most heavily regulated
2016-04-24 16:05:54	akaseki	crutchy, because it went unregulated for decades and AMAZINGLY companies won't improve on infrastructure unless they are forced to
2016-04-24 16:06:00	crutchy	lol
2016-04-24 16:06:04	crutchy	nonsense
2016-04-24 16:06:11	Animeconnoisseur	Lobbyists often use the government to push more regulations that don't bother them I guess
2016-04-24 16:06:14	akaseki	crutchy, so now the us has shit infrastructure because the govt. didn't improve it and companies just ran it ragged 
2016-04-24 16:06:18	jnylen	crutchy, instead the government paid the biggest companies to dig fibre lines
2016-04-24 16:06:22	jnylen	but they just took the money and didnt
2016-04-24 16:06:27	pyon	crutchy: Here, telcos aren't regulated properly (mostly because regulators have no fucking idea what to do), and we customers pay the price dearly.
2016-04-24 16:06:36	crutchy	google is working around governments to make their own networks
2016-04-24 16:06:37	akaseki	jnylen, was getting to that; that was the most fun shit
2016-04-24 16:07:07	crutchy	pyon, governments suck at regulating
2016-04-24 16:07:08	pyon	crutchy: I pay probably 2x what an American would pay for their Internets, and get 1/10x of the speed.
2016-04-24 16:07:18	crutchy	regulations only hurt the little guys
2016-04-24 16:07:18	jnylen	crutchy, shouldn't have to be a fucking big company like Google to make shit happened though
2016-04-24 16:07:20	akaseki	crutchy, you keep saying that like it makes any sense
2016-04-24 16:07:42	crutchy	google is the only company that can afford the red tape and the capital investment
2016-04-24 16:07:49	crutchy	all other companies are driven out
2016-04-24 16:07:56	akaseki	crutchy, you know why regulation doesn't really work at times?
2016-04-24 16:08:10	crutchy	regulation has made it too expensive for other companies to build their own networks
2016-04-24 16:08:17	akaseki	crutchy, because - as i said - a company will try any possible way (generally within the confines of legality) to maximize revenue and reduce cost

2016-04-24 16:08:33	akaseki	crutchy, the best example i can give you is with the pay-day loan businesses in the US
2016-04-24 16:08:42	crutchy	akaseki, profit is the only reason why most people even get out of bed in the morning
2016-04-24 16:09:02	crutchy	without the profit motive you get the USSR
2016-04-24 16:09:04	pyon	crutchy: Profit? I'm not sure I would call merely surviving “profit”.
2016-04-24 16:09:17	akaseki	crutchy, the business model is meant to keep the sucker paying continuously week after week
2016-04-24 16:09:25	crutchy	pyon, if you didn't get paid to go to work you wouldn't bother going to work
2016-04-24 16:09:29	pyon	crutchy: I know lots of people who wake up at 5am merely to make enough money to survive.
2016-04-24 16:09:38	pyon	crutchy: I wake up a lot later than them.
2016-04-24 16:09:38	crutchy	pyon, but they choose to do that
2016-04-24 16:09:41	akaseki	crutchy, the states involved tried to regulate these businesses to avoid a situation where people became basically more and more in debt
2016-04-24 16:09:53	pyon	crutchy: Not that they have much of a choice. The alternative is starving - them and their families.
2016-04-24 16:09:57	crutchy	akaseki, regulation is putting more and more people in debt
2016-04-24 16:10:04	jnylen	crutchy, we have regulations in Sweden regarding the lines. Every ISP can use them, the state owns most major lines and can't deny access to ISPs.
2016-04-24 16:10:12	akaseki	crutchy, they changed the law to not allow for short-term debts under a sum, they increased the sum, they modified rules for required paper-work, they called it something else and moved on
2016-04-24 16:10:17	crutchy	pyon, if they got fired tomorrow they would find another job or go on welfare
2016-04-24 16:10:17	jnylen	if they abuse it they get regulated
2016-04-24 16:10:21	crutchy	they wouldn't starve
2016-04-24 16:10:22	jnylen	it is so fucking easy
2016-04-24 16:10:24	pyon	crutchy: Welfare? There's no such thing here.
2016-04-24 16:10:31	akaseki	crutchy, a continuous hassle to keep the companies from fucking over their customers (in this case)
2016-04-24 16:10:32	pyon	crutchy: If you're unemployed, you're literally fucked.
2016-04-24 16:10:32	crutchy	then they would find another job
2016-04-24 16:10:39	pyon	crutchy: Hah.
2016-04-24 16:11:03	crutchy	people don't appreciate their employment sometimes till they lose it
2016-04-24 16:11:13	beaky	yes im unemployed
2016-04-24 16:11:18	akaseki	crutchy, now from your perspective that only means the govt. sucks at regulation
2016-04-24 16:11:18	beaky	still not fucked
2016-04-24 16:11:31	akaseki	crutchy, but they don't necessarily suck, it's just the defender's paradox in practice
2016-04-24 16:11:34	crutchy	beaky, most countries have some sort of safety net
2016-04-24 16:11:34	pyon	crutchy: There's more informal than formal employment here. “Informal employment” means “you aren't even paid minimum wage, have no healthcare, and are basically fucked in every way imaginable”.
2016-04-24 16:11:50	crutchy	akaseki, they do suck. because there is no incentive for them not to suck
2016-04-24 16:11:54	akaseki	crutchy, in essence, no matter how good the defense of something is, it will always fail
2016-04-24 16:12:00	crutchy	government has no profit motive
2016-04-24 16:12:11	akaseki	crutchy, and govt with regulations is generally playing defense 
2016-04-24 16:12:19	crutchy	no its not
2016-04-24 16:12:30	akaseki	yes it is
2016-04-24 16:12:41	crutchy	its just bureaucrats trying to justify their own salaries
2016-04-24 16:12:49	akaseki	hmm
2016-04-24 16:12:58	akaseki	i'm going to stop this conversation now

2016-04-24 16:13:09	crutchy	because they don't have to
2016-04-24 16:13:24	crutchy	they just go to work, waste a bunch of taxpayer dollars, then go home

2016-04-24 18:42:14	Kazuto	akaseki: Mm.
2016-04-24 18:42:16	akaseki	Kazuto, MAL recently got a lot of improvements and repairs, but it still feels like shit; strictly from this pov Hummingbird is superior 
2016-04-24 18:42:40	Kazuto	Gotcha. I made an account but haven't really gotten around to using it yet
2016-04-24 18:42:44	akaseki	Kazuto, however, Hummingbird's ui is too much Web 2.0 -> Web 3.0 garbage for me tbh and i give it negs for that
2016-04-24 18:42:58	akaseki	but their community is (still) much less toxic than MAL

And now, for the first time, a male has awoken to these powers and has enrolled into the school. There's just one problem: he turns out to be a genius psychotic killer who plans to systematically kill every last girl at the school.

2016-04-27 13:34:40	vruum	i didn't want to fall in the "too much of a nice guy" pit this time, so I thought I should ask #anime
2016-04-27 13:34:44	Avonis	you can return the item

2016-04-27 13:35:48	vruum	Lovepon: i was thinking of giving him the money, but on the other hand he also gave a wrong number to "save his ass"

2016-04-27 13:36:02	vruum	and then said it was returned by customs
2016-04-27 13:36:17	vruum	yes, because he had to ship within 7 days, but probably didn't have it in stock
2016-04-27 13:36:36	vruum	so he gave a fake nr to have time to get the item and ship it
2016-04-27 13:36:58	vruum	or gave the wrong nr by mistake...
2016-04-27 13:37:26	vruum	but then why would he say it was returned by customs, only when I asked about it?
2016-04-27 13:37:34	Lovepon	I'm not sure if I should go passive agressive or what.
2016-04-27 13:37:34	+Moyst	It's 'aggressive'.
2016-04-27 13:37:51	Lovepon	vruum: I'd say that he got the wrong nr himself.

2016-04-27 13:38:40	vruum	but the item that arrived has a tracking nr

2016-04-27 13:39:55	Lovepon	Welp, I'm gonna assume that that's something useful rather than an anime figurine or something.

2016-04-27 13:42:13	vruum	should my decision depend on the fact that I don't need the item anymore? should I return the money thus feeding this kind of (somewhat dishonest) behavior from the seller?
2016-04-27 13:42:26	vruum	cask: correct
2016-04-27 13:42:30	cask	If you're not going to pay him for it, send it back to him and if it will cost you money to do so, make him pay. 
2016-04-27 13:42:46	cask	No point being involved in this any more than necessary. 
2016-04-27 13:43:01	Lovepon	The obvious answer is kewep the money and return the item.
2016-04-27 13:43:02	vruum	cask: send him back would cost 3 to 4 times the price of the item, so he won't want it back
2016-04-27 13:43:17	Lovepon	Okay.
2016-04-27 13:43:20	cask	That's ridiculous.

2016-04-27 13:44:08	cask	I'd say the fact that he sent it late kind of absolves you from having to do the nice thing and pay him/return it. 
2016-04-27 13:44:35	Lovepon	vruum: He was willing to pay you back, despite not knowing exactly what happened to the item.

2016-04-29 10:26:24	Sinex	hi guys
2016-04-29 10:26:26	crutchy	someoine offering services on behalf of a company is not offering bribes
2016-04-29 10:26:45	crutchy	its only taking a bribe on the politicians part because he personally benefits at the expense of taxpayers
2016-04-29 10:27:24	crutchy	if the politician was accepting the services of a company on behalf of taxpayers, it wouldn't be bribery
2016-04-29 10:27:48	crutchy	surely you know what bribery is?
2016-04-29 10:27:51	pyon	crutchy: Dude, the act of bribing doesn't happen just because the receiver wants it. In fact, the party with the biggest interest in the transaction is the bribe giver.
2016-04-29 10:28:06	KingKeA	i think i'm gaining an understanding of the argument here.
2016-04-29 10:28:26	crutchy	pyon, that would make all business guilty of bribery
2016-04-29 10:28:31	pyon	crutchy: Not really.
2016-04-29 10:28:32	KingKeA	crutchy is saying bribebery is only an issue when it applies to politicians right?
2016-04-29 10:28:34	crutchy	because they are all trying to sell stuff
2016-04-29 10:28:42	pyon	crutchy: Selling stuff is okay.
2016-04-29 10:28:47	pyon	crutchy: Advertising stuff is okay.
2016-04-29 10:28:59	crutchy	so businesses can't sell stuff to government?
2016-04-29 10:29:05	pyon	crutchy: Oh, they can.
2016-04-29 10:29:16	crutchy	then how it is offering bribes?
2016-04-29 10:29:16	pyon	crutchy: That's why the state has a set of processes for selecting suppliers.
2016-04-29 10:29:22	KingKeA	eh nevermind. someone plese tl;dr what is the argument here?
2016-04-29 10:29:30	crutchy	businesses will sell to whoever is willing to buy
2016-04-29 10:29:37	pyon	crutchy: It's a bribe if they offer money to a politician or bureaucrat to skip this process.
2016-04-29 10:30:22	crutchy	that makes the politician the one that's offering the service though
2016-04-29 10:30:28	crutchy	the compoany is merely opaying for it
2016-04-29 10:30:38	pyon	crutchy: whut
2016-04-29 10:30:51	crutchy	how can a company buy something unless it is offered?
2016-04-29 10:31:04	crutchy	you don't buy something that isn't available
2016-04-29 10:31:19	pyon	crutchy: Even if I accept your idiotic premise, buying illegal services is, well, *illegal*.
2016-04-29 10:31:26	crutchy	if the politician wasn't offering to skip the process, how could the company pay for it?
2016-04-29 10:31:58	pyon	crutchy: If the company's management were ethical, they wouldn't accept the offer.
2016-04-29 10:32:13	pyon	crutchy: If anything, they would expose the politician for making such an offer.
2016-04-29 10:32:33	crutchy	they are simply buying something that will serve the businesses interests, as with any supplier or subcontractor
2016-04-29 10:32:33	pyon	crutchy: Or, if they don't want trouble, they could just decline.

2016-04-29 10:33:16	crutchy	dude you're talking about the politician
2016-04-29 10:33:22	crutchy	he's the one selling services
2016-04-29 10:33:31	pyon	I'm talking about both.
2016-04-29 10:33:34	crutchy	the business isn't doing anything unusual
2016-04-29 10:33:43	crutchy	they are simply buying what is on offer
2016-04-29 10:33:45	pyon	crutchy: It's paying a fucking bribe!
2016-04-29 10:34:30	crutchy	how do they know?
2016-04-29 10:35:04	pyon	crutchy: How do they know? Well, because they're paying a politician or bureaucrat money to do business with *the state*.
2016-04-29 10:35:16	crutchy	all government contractors do that
2016-04-29 10:36:05	crutchy	like if i go  to the post office and buy a stamp, am i offering a bribe to the post office?
2016-04-29 10:36:21	pyon	crutchy: If instead of a bureaucrat, if were another company's purchasing manager, the purchasing manager would be (0) fired, (1) probably sued too.

2016-04-29 10:42:16	pyon	crutchy: The state has its own set of processes for selecting suppliers of whatever goods and services it needs.
2016-04-29 10:42:21	crutchy	if the politician is acting on behalf of someone else, that's his business
2016-04-29 10:42:33	pyon	crutchy: The politician is brokering a deal between the lobbyist's employer and the state.
2016-04-29 10:42:38	Lovepon	Hmmmm.
2016-04-29 10:42:57	pyon	crutchy: No matter how you slice it, it's illegal.
2016-04-29 10:42:59	crutchy	pyon, if he was only brokering he wouldn't get to keep the proceeds
2016-04-29 10:43:37	pyon	crutchy: Huh? That doesn't make sense. If I want to buy a house, I can use a broker's services to find someone interested in selling a house that more or less matches my needs.
2016-04-29 10:44:27	crutchy	dude it would be like if you bought a house and the broker pocketed the money you paid
2016-04-29 10:44:36	pyon	crutchy: And the broker obviously gets a cut. But that's okay, because both parties (buyer and seller) are consenting to this.
2016-04-29 10:44:43	crutchy	its not the broker's house, just like its not the politicians money
2016-04-29 10:45:03	crutchy	if the politician was making a deal with his own money it would be fine
2016-04-29 10:45:20	crutchy	but hes making a deal for himself using taxpayer money
2016-04-29 10:45:29	pyon	crutchy: The broker is providing a service to *both* the buyer and the seller - namely, facilitating the transaction.
2016-04-29 10:45:42	pyon	crutchy: On the other hand, the politician is *NOT* providing a service to the state.
2016-04-29 10:45:55	crutchy	wat?
2016-04-29 10:45:58	pyon	crutchy: The state never asked the politician to select a supplier on the basis of bribes.
2016-04-29 10:46:10	crutchy	dude a politician taking a bribe is not a broker lol
2016-04-29 10:46:29	pyon	crutchy: From the POV of the business paying the bribe, the politician is acting as a broker.
2016-04-29 10:46:41	crutchy	yes, which is why its not illegal for the business to do that
2016-04-29 10:46:44	pyon	crutchy: And, of course, from the POV of the state, well, the state is being defrauded.
2016-04-29 10:46:53	crutchy	they don't know the politician is gunna pocket the proceeds
2016-04-29 10:47:06	crutchy	yes, by the 'broker'

2016-04-30 12:13:23	IspiraWeb	What you want for video editing is more cores

2016-04-30 12:13:30	IspiraWeb	or an fx-8350
2016-04-30 12:13:31	Adyrhan	yup, that usually happens when most of your build, your... i5-6600, GTX 960 4GB, 16GB of DDR4-2400, Dual SSD boot drives, etc

2016-04-30 13:51:40	Interject_Robot	not to sound elitiest, but yt's compression makes most songs sound like shit.

2016-04-30 13:52:05	crutchy	ooh i read about that
2016-04-30 13:52:07	Sadale	I have been there, after its destruction :p
2016-04-30 13:52:16	Interject_Robot	I'm pretty obsessed with surround sound music. there's nothing that compares to a properly formmated 5.1 channel song.

2016-04-30 13:52:39	Interject_Robot	of course if you don't have a surround song system or nice headphones it really doesn't matter
2016-04-30 13:52:44	crutchy	sound system is only one part of decent sound
2016-04-30 13:53:05	Interject_Robot	but if you know what you're looking for a nice pair of cans only costs about $50. the trick is to actually know what nice headphones are instead of listening to marketing.

2016-04-30 13:53:51	crutchy	not the best, but not the worst
2016-04-30 13:54:22	Interject_Robot	actually, here's an interesting related bit of marketing shadiness, did you know that laptops and other devices that feature "beats" audio, will have 2 EQ settings, one that's "good" (and heavy on bass, which tricks laymen into thinking good) and one that's tinny as all hell. turning beats on simply turns off the tinny bullshit eq.
2016-04-30 13:54:30	Interject_Robot	it's amazing how underhanded that marketing is.
2016-04-30 13:54:38	Interject_Robot	they're litterally selling you nothing.
2016-04-30 13:54:58	crutchy	i use a receiver

2016-04-30 13:56:05	Interject_Robot	here's a tip if anyone cares: the more something spends on marketing, the worse it's probably gonna be. 
2016-04-30 13:56:06	Animeconnoisseur	the video with the people saying "whoah it sounds so much better! 24bit 96KHz is the best!"
2016-04-30 13:56:19	Urchin	Sadale: while I'm pretty tight with space, I can make a Prusa i3 fit
2016-04-30 13:56:30	Animeconnoisseur	they were likely playing compressed and uncompressed tracks
2016-04-30 13:56:31	Sadale	Urchin, you're lucky. I got other family members ;_;
2016-04-30 13:56:40	Animeconnoisseur	the uncompressed tracks being on the pono
2016-04-30 13:56:48	Sadale	Urchin, I don't want to take their space because I'd only use the printer occasionally.
2016-04-30 13:56:55	Interject_Robot	my headphones ... which I can't even remember the brand of right now, are mostly unmarketed, I had never heard of them before researching them. That's one of the indications that it's actually a solid product. Products that don't spend on marketing rely on word of mouth to sell their product
2016-04-30 13:56:57	crutchy	Interject_Robot, dunno if i agree with that, but i can't disprove it
2016-04-30 13:57:00	Interject_Robot	that means the product needs to ACTUALLY be good.
2016-04-30 13:57:05	crutchy	re: amrketing

2016-04-30 13:57:25	Animeconnoisseur	headphones are rather subjective

2016-04-30 13:57:44	Animeconnoisseur	but some headphones are objectively rather flat sounding for example
2016-04-30 13:57:50	Sadale	Urchin, guess what? We can get a Prusa i3 for like <$230 USD from taobao. :3
2016-04-30 13:57:52	Animeconnoisseur	I love my hd 600
2016-04-30 13:57:54	Urchin	Sadale: I also have family members
2016-04-30 13:58:04	crutchy	Interject_Robot, the benefit of buying something that's mass  produced is that it can be cheaper than similar botique products
2016-04-30 13:58:06	Animeconnoisseur	they sound natural
2016-04-30 13:58:09	Sadale	Urchin, oh wait. I thought that you was pyon
2016-04-30 13:58:11	Animeconnoisseur	no bloated anything
2016-04-30 13:58:17	crutchy	and mass production can actually have some decent qc
2016-04-30 13:58:17	Interject_Robot	you can mass produce something without marketing it heavily
2016-04-30 13:58:20	Sadale	Now it makes sense.

2016-04-30 13:58:37	Interject_Robot	for example, did you know that 70% of the cost of a beats headphones comes from marketing costs.
2016-04-30 13:58:38	crutchy	Interject_Robot, you can, but its not common
2016-04-30 13:58:46	Animeconnoisseur	No joke
2016-04-30 13:58:53	Interject_Robot	Hang on, I'm gonna check what model mine are so I can have a tangible example.
2016-04-30 13:58:53	Sadale	Urchin, what's the area of your apartment? :p
2016-04-30 13:58:54	crutchy	if you're gunna mass produce something, you need high sales to justify it
2016-04-30 13:58:59	Animeconnoisseur	Interject_Robot: how much did you pay for yours
2016-04-30 13:59:04	Animeconnoisseur	and what's the model

2016-04-30 14:03:29	Interject_Robot	I'm not really elitiest either, if someone thinks their iphone headphones are good enough for them, that's fine. But I don't think it does the music justice.
2016-04-30 14:03:33	crutchy	though i hate mowing it :p
2016-04-30 14:03:44	Sadale	crutchy, Even rural lands are very expensive here. They're like 70% or 50% of price of urban area.

2016-04-30 14:09:07	Urchin	Sadale: anyway, back to 3d printers, I'll probably just get a kit directly from Prusa
2016-04-30 14:09:11	Animeconnoisseur	I kinda wish I could own speakers

2016-04-30 14:09:44	Interject_Robot	I really hope 3D Printing doesn't get all DRM'd up.
2016-04-30 14:09:50	Interject_Robot	like it's currently looking like it might.
2016-04-30 14:09:52	Sadale	Urchin, unfortunately, there's no such thing accessible for me for building a smartrap. I sourced all the parts myself. And you know, it's much risker. :(

2016-04-30 14:42:50	beaky	not as bad as php though
2016-04-30 14:43:02	Interject_Robot	For me, jailbreaking is important becuase my phone is very important to my every day life
2016-04-30 14:43:09	crutchy	yeah php is so shit
2016-04-30 14:43:23	crutchy	wikipedia and facebook are retarded for using it!
2016-04-30 14:43:31	Interject_Robot	I'm just a picky asshole, for example, I love having my reminders listed on my lockscreen at all times, it makes it so much easier for me, becuase I'll NEVER open the reminder app.
2016-04-30 14:43:41	Interject_Robot	I have an attentional disorder, so my phone is basically my external mind.
2016-04-30 14:43:46	crutchy	lol
2016-04-30 14:43:51	crutchy	yeah i guess thats common
2016-04-30 14:44:07	Interject_Robot	and since I have such a "intimate" relationship with it, I like having it setup just how I want
2016-04-30 14:44:11	crutchy	i use mine for phone, texting, alarm and the odd game
2016-04-30 14:44:16	Interject_Robot	think about your computer, if you couldn't install 3rd party things you'd be pretty pissed
2016-04-30 14:44:22	Avonis	nnno, messing with your phone is awesome !!!
2016-04-30 14:44:34	Avonis	flashing ROMs, MODS, multiple ROMS booting
2016-04-30 14:44:37	crutchy	Interject_Robot, what if you lost your phone or it was stolen?
2016-04-30 14:44:56	crutchy	pretty easy to have happen
2016-04-30 14:44:58	Interject_Robot	well, I don't see that happening, but, if I did, I'd get a new one and restore my backups.
2016-04-30 14:45:05	Avonis	hell the Viper4android SOUND MOD took my HTC ONE M7 audio quality to heavens
2016-04-30 14:45:30	Interject_Robot	i'm pretty obsessive about knowing where my phone is at all times. It's gotten to the point where sometimes I put it in my pocket at home becuase walking around without it feels weird.
2016-04-30 14:45:43	crutchy	Avonis, tbh the plain ol' default android music player aint bad with the eq and dsp settings custom tuned

2016-04-30 14:46:05	Interject_Robot	that's one thing I love about android over ios, drag and drop music
2016-04-30 14:46:25	Avonis	crutchy, yep I was like that, until I started flashing sound MODs, they are some serious shit
2016-04-30 14:46:29	Interject_Robot	though at the sametime, the android SD card is such a fucking mess it drives me insane.
2016-04-30 14:46:58	Avonis	crutchy, and yes they are DSP/engines, but with libraries and stuff
2016-04-30 14:47:10	Avonis	and not your common music player DSP/Equiliser
2016-04-30 14:47:14	crutchy	i'm probably just not much of an audiophile
2016-04-30 14:47:32	crutchy	though i do have certain sound preferences
2016-04-30 14:47:40	Interject_Robot	TBH when I start fucking with DSP and shit it always ends up sounding wrong. I guess I'm not savvy enough so I just leave it alone.

2016-04-30 14:48:54	crutchy	i don't like the 50-100-odd hz doof doof bass. i hate midrange, i like a bit of ambience and some nice non-static non-crackly high freq

2016-04-30 14:50:25	Avonis	still a V :p

2016-04-30 14:54:00	Interject_Robot	basically, internet money. It's an interesting tech. 
2016-04-30 14:54:04	crutchy	i don't really use a normal eq :p
2016-04-30 14:54:11	Interject_Robot	but it can be used for things other than internet money, which is what a lot of people miss
2016-04-30 14:54:21	beaky	ah
2016-04-30 14:54:24	IceFireXD	crutchy: is that winamp? o.o
2016-04-30 14:54:26	Interject_Robot	it could be used for voting, for example.

2016-04-30 14:54:49	Interject_Robot	It's built in a way that everyone can see every transaction on something called the blockchain, making it hard to cheat the system, actually, impossible.
2016-04-30 14:54:49	IceFireXD	sweet

2016-04-30 14:55:30	IceFireXD	and i'm using v5.24
2016-04-30 14:55:36	beaky	why not use the cloud instead of bitcoin Interject_Robot 
2016-04-30 14:55:36	Interject_Robot	it's a kind of security dealing with transparency, if everyone can see every transaction, you can't spend the same bitcoin twice, and etc. it's also de-centrizlied, meaning that no one is in charge of it.
2016-04-30 14:55:37	Avonis	but it's low pitched

2016-04-30 14:57:35	Interject_Robot	there was a scare, a while ago, with bitcoin, people were worried that if you owned more than 50% of miners, you could do a "51% attack" which, if executed properply, could allow the temporary double spending of bitcoins

2016-04-30 14:59:11	Interject_Robot	the problem is people dismiss bitcoin becuase they don't understand it. The underlying tech, the blockchain, is probably the greatest technological invention of the 21st century.

2016-04-30 15:02:27	Interject_Robot	internet, it's for some type of exchange.

2016-05-04 10:01:44	mabino-pyon	mathu: Just wondering, how likely is it that he's Satoshi, but actually wants others (mainly, tax authorities) to think it's not him? Say, the Australian tax authorities already know that Satoshi is Australian, and want to tax the hell out of him, so he's doing all of this to evade them.
2016-05-04 10:01:44	cask	That actually seems feasible to me, given how flip-floppy Wright's been.

2016-05-04 10:03:02	mabino-pyon	mathu: It would be a pretty stupid way to go about it, but he could be desperate or something?
2016-05-04 10:03:09	mathu	mabino-pyon: i think the reason he claimed to be satoshi is because he wants to claim a large volume of money as untaxed/not laundered/something so he said "it's bitcoin!" but the only way for his amount of money to be bitcoin would be if he were satoshi himself
2016-05-04 10:03:13	shug-senpai	I prefer him over Clinton tho
2016-05-04 10:03:44	mathu	mabino-pyon: i never read much about it, but i was under the impression that if it's not proved that he is satoshi, he will be in trouble

2016-05-11 13:27:53	crutchy	communism 101

2016-05-11 13:29:07	Sadale	crutchy, ah. I thought that my move, you meant the rich guys move to another country physically

2016-05-11 13:30:24	davic	Sadale: the employers play social fees and you are legally allowed x amount of vacation days per month, they do the taxes for you so you just need to OK it each year
2016-05-11 13:30:27	Sadale	sweden seems good for me
2016-05-11 13:30:59	davic	Sadale: 1.5 years of parental leave

2016-05-11 13:31:35	crutchy	sweden is probably good for people that don't pay much tax. it probably seems awesome. but at the end of the day someone's gotta pay for it
2016-05-11 13:31:43	davic	Sadale: if you kid got disabilities the school is by law forced to help it
2016-05-11 13:32:27	davic	Taxation in Sweden on salaries for an employee involves contributing to three different levels of government: the municipality, the county council, and the central government. Social security contributions are paid to finance the social security system.
2016-05-11 13:32:27	Sadale	crutchy, I'm willing to pay for more tax.
2016-05-11 13:32:29	davic	Income tax on salaries is deducted by the employer (a PAYE system) and paid directly by the employer to the Swedish Tax Agency (Skatteverket).
2016-05-11 13:32:33	beaky	damn 
2016-05-11 13:32:34	crutchy	and if rich people move their money to panama, it leaves the middle class to pick up the tab
2016-05-11 13:32:37	beaky	why does mushshi make me cry
2016-05-11 13:33:02	crutchy	this works for a while. eventually the burden becomes too heavy and the middle class dwindles
2016-05-11 13:33:11	Sadale	crutchy, why should the middle class cares?
2016-05-11 13:33:31	Sadale	Even if they care, they don't have the ability to move to another country, probably :p
2016-05-11 13:33:57	mosasaur	why is Sweden so empty? Don't they have sex during the winter?

2016-05-18 11:59:53	Myrl-saki	amigojapan: memset.
2016-05-18 12:00:19	Myrl-saki	amigojapan: https://docs.python.org/2/library/ctypes.html#ctypes.memset
2016-05-18 12:00:19	+Enju	[title] 15.17. ctypes — A foreign function library for Python — Python 2.7.11 documentation
2016-05-18 12:00:32	Illya	Elsah: so yeah
2016-05-18 12:00:35	Myrl-saki	amigojapan: It's possible if you're crazy enough.
2016-05-18 12:00:37	Illya	that means link it, right?
2016-05-18 12:00:54	Elsah	Illya: "tell them I'll pass"
2016-05-18 12:00:57	Elsah	means no
2016-05-18 12:01:09	Illya	>:(
2016-05-18 12:01:17	Illya	tell them that they're boring
2016-05-18 12:01:38	amigojapan	ok Myrl-saki there is a reason why there are called "ctypes"
2016-05-18 12:02:12	Myrl-saki	amigojapan: Yeah, it's because it's a foreign function interface? It doesn't necesarily need C.
2016-05-18 12:02:51	cask	Noragami has an excellent soundtrack. 
2016-05-18 12:02:54	amigojapan	Myrl-saki: ok, if python is not memory safe, it is not good for beginner programmers, and what I said is false
2016-05-18 12:02:58	Illya	Gotta love them fast win 10 boot times
2016-05-18 12:03:15	Myrl-saki	Illya: Gotta love them 10 seconds boot time on an HDD, because LINUX.
2016-05-18 12:03:15	cask	I'm not a big fan of the style if the show though. The comedic interludes are starting to get annoying. 
2016-05-18 12:03:17	Illya	3 seconds 
2016-05-18 12:03:20	cask	Just stick to the story. Jeez.
2016-05-18 12:03:25	Illya	Myrl-saki: 3 seconds. 
2016-05-18 12:03:30	Myrl-saki	Illya: SSD?
2016-05-18 12:03:35	Illya	Nah
2016-05-18 12:03:48	Illya	It probably just ram disks everything immediately though 
2016-05-18 12:03:51	Myrl-saki	Illya: I could get that with Arch Linux.
2016-05-18 12:03:55	Illya	I have 16GB ram 
2016-05-18 12:04:03	Myrl-saki	And I have.
2016-05-18 12:04:11	Illya	In my desktop anyways
2016-05-18 12:04:13	amigojapan	Myrl-saki: there are though some things python can do that C cant, like eval()
2016-05-18 12:04:19	Myrl-saki	Illya: How do you even ramdisk...?
2016-05-18 12:04:30	Myrl-saki	amigojapan: C can do that. Metacompilation.
2016-05-18 12:04:41	Myrl-saki	Woops.
2016-05-18 12:04:43	Myrl-saki	Not metacompilation.
2016-05-18 12:04:48	Illya	Windows probably does, idk how else it can be fast
2016-05-18 12:04:51	Myrl-saki	I forgot the term for it.
2016-05-18 12:04:53	Illya	Myrl-saki: jit
2016-05-18 12:05:05	Myrl-saki	Illya: No, think about it. How does it ramdisk if it's... turned off?
2016-05-18 12:05:17	Illya	Well, you turn it on
2016-05-18 12:05:34	amigojapan	Myrl-saki: even if there is some C on the fly compiler, C is less portable, and would not really be multyplatform, so it would nto be quite as useful as eval()
2016-05-18 12:05:45	Myrl-saki	C is *not* less portable.
2016-05-18 12:05:51	Myrl-saki	Sweet jesus, why does everyone keep saying that?
2016-05-18 12:05:56	Myrl-saki	It's really getting on my nerves, tbh.
2016-05-18 12:06:02	Illya	Jruby is best high level language 
2016-05-18 12:06:08	Myrl-saki	Heck, C is even more portable than Java.
2016-05-18 12:06:13	amigojapan	Myrl-saki: cause there are libraries that are system specific
2016-05-18 12:06:23	Myrl-saki	Java enforces their "urgh, muh big endian."
2016-05-18 12:06:31	Myrl-saki	While C just gives no shit.
2016-05-18 12:06:54	Myrl-saki	Illya: I hate Java. :^)
2016-05-18 12:07:07	amigojapan	in that I agree, I dont like java very much
2016-05-18 12:07:23	Myrl-saki	amigojapan: Oh, and the Python interpreter is also system specific.
2016-05-18 12:07:52	Myrl-saki	In the sense that "if it's not implemented, then it won't work on that architecture."
2016-05-18 12:08:02	amigojapan	Myrl-saki: ok
2016-05-18 12:08:28	crutchy	solar is fairly popular here
2016-05-18 12:08:39	crutchy	oh woops
2016-05-18 12:08:43	crutchy	stupid scrollback
2016-05-18 12:08:55	cask	Where is here?
2016-05-18 12:09:18	crutchy	my cursor was only like an hour behind :p
2016-05-18 12:09:23	amigojapan	Myrl-saki: it is just easier to keep a multyplatform (windows mac and linux) program in a language that is designed for multiplatform, than in C where you will need to do tons of #ifdef conditional compilation for a big projhect
2016-05-18 12:09:30	Elsah	jesus

2016-05-18 12:11:14	Illya	I hate it when people say they hate java when I talk about jruby
2016-05-18 12:11:17	Illya	It's not even java
2016-05-18 12:11:25	Illya	It's just running on the JVM
2016-05-18 12:11:33	crutchy	it's ruby with a spelling mistake?

2016-05-18 12:12:06	Illya	It's Ruby on the JVM
2016-05-18 12:12:17	⚡	crutchy has only managed to cobble together one ruby script
2016-05-18 12:12:23	amigojapan	Myrl-saki: for bitwise stuff, I think c++ has most tools for it, using boost
2016-05-18 12:12:55	Myrl-saki	amigojapan: C shouldn't have problems with bitwise either, unless someone's using it wrong.
2016-05-18 12:13:49	amigojapan	Myrl-saki: C++ has very useful datastructures for bitwise operations like bitsets
2016-05-18 12:13:52	Elsah	crutchy, you're a dirty cobbler
2016-05-18 12:15:23	Myrl-saki	amigojapan: Yes.

2016-05-18 12:49:17	hi117	kabeneri is the better version of AoT
2016-05-18 12:49:24	Corin	No, that's not right.
2016-05-18 12:49:32	Corin	Kabaneri isn't good at face value.
2016-05-18 12:49:39	Corin	It's intentionally bad.
2016-05-18 12:50:14	Corin	Written to trigger as many tropes as possible, 'cause the writer loves laughing at how many morons eat that shit up.
2016-05-18 12:50:55	pooshiro	no Corin all that writer does it write trash, he probably has connections to stay employed
2016-05-18 12:51:27	Corin	He's rather [in]famous for writing Code Geass.
2016-05-18 12:51:39	Corin	Which is probably what gets him jobs.

2016-05-18 12:53:47	Corin	His most shining example, though, was Valvrave.
2016-05-18 12:54:21	hi117	nexia: np
2016-05-18 12:54:24	Corin	He's done it several times. Code Geass, Guilty Crown, Valvrave, Kabaneri...
2016-05-18 12:54:30	Corin	Actually watch his stuff closely...
2016-05-18 12:54:37	vash	wow gods of egypt was a terrible movie

2016-05-18 12:55:16	Corin	He can do amazing serious shows if he wants to though. He's a very talented writer.
2016-05-18 12:55:23	Corin	Just watch Planetes and see.

2016-05-18 12:55:54	vash	dude what
2016-05-18 12:56:03	Corin	hi117: The manga and anime are entirely different.
2016-05-18 12:56:07	nexia	who tries 5 minutes of anything before deleting?
2016-05-18 12:56:17	nexia	[except vash, Kappa]
2016-05-18 12:56:17	Corin	nexia: Idiots.
2016-05-18 12:56:17	pooshiro	it was no good nexia 
2016-05-18 12:56:18	hi117	the manga has an interesting art style
2016-05-18 12:56:24	◣	Tools (~Casper@some.hidden.network) has left #anime
2016-05-18 12:56:36	nexia	Corin, well it just seems unreasonable to any show or work, yeah lol
2016-05-18 12:56:37	hi117	nexia: everyone knows the 3 episode rule
2016-05-18 12:56:44	hi117	...right?
2016-05-18 12:56:50	Mr-ex777	hi117: i do not
2016-05-18 12:56:50	Corin	Yeah, three episodes.
2016-05-18 12:57:04	nexia	I have always stuck by 7-10 episodes lol
2016-05-18 12:57:05	pooshiro	no hi117 thats a made up rule sub groups made up
2016-05-18 12:57:07	Corin	Although, I did drop one show this season after just 1.
2016-05-18 12:57:07	cask	Watch 5 random minutes of any 3 episodes of the series and if you don't like it, delete.
2016-05-18 12:57:09	cask	Sure.
2016-05-18 12:57:11	hi117	i mean thats like dropping madoka on the first episode because its a happy magical girl show
2016-05-18 12:57:33	vash	i dropped world trigger after about 4 minutes
2016-05-18 12:57:35	nexia	i tend to not pick up a lot of anime altogether, as a tradeoff which is just as bad t_t
2016-05-18 12:57:37	Corin	pooshiro: It's not. It's a rule that a ton of people came up with independently, and it's also a rule that applies to many other things.
2016-05-18 12:57:39	nexia	vash, KNEW IT
2016-05-18 12:57:47	nexia	vash: it gets so much better yo
2016-05-18 12:57:47	vash	┐('～`；)┌
2016-05-18 12:57:50	hi117	vash: if i remember world trigger right you didnt miss much
2016-05-18 12:57:52	pooshiro	no Corin you can tell a show is trash in a few minutes
2016-05-18 12:57:53	vash	i was right to drop it
2016-05-18 12:58:13	hi117	Corin: dont feed the trolls
2016-05-18 12:58:13	Corin	Like, when using the scientific method, generally, 3 is the fewest number of times a test should be repeated.
2016-05-18 12:58:17	nexia	it became more interesting later on/enjoyable for sure
2016-05-18 12:58:37	nexia	but i guess it's more of like an improved naruto/bleach for me
2016-05-18 12:58:39	nexia	more than anything
2016-05-18 12:58:46	vash	i could just tell, it's extra shounen-y
2016-05-18 12:58:57	Corin	I dropped Kiznaiver after 1 ep.
2016-05-18 12:59:02	Myrl-saki	I should stick with a scribble signature instead of a structured one instead...
2016-05-18 12:59:05	vash	too old for that shit
2016-05-18 12:59:09	nexia	vash: kek
2016-05-18 12:59:10	hi117	im struggling throught kiznavier
2016-05-18 12:59:20	nexia	it's not insanely bad
2016-05-18 12:59:21	hi117	it really flopped imo
2016-05-18 12:59:23	nexia	vash: yeah i get you
2016-05-18 12:59:42	Corin	Would've stuck it out a little longer, but it drew the short straw and I didn't have the time to keep up with it.
2016-05-18 13:00:00	hi117	on the flip side though my week revolves around when the next episode of re: comes out
2016-05-18 13:00:06	nexia	on second thought, maybe not everyone cares about that sort of action stuff plotline, but i did think the main characters had some nice character progression
2016-05-18 13:00:11	Avonis	what you following this season Corin ?
2016-05-18 13:00:11	hi117	mc is so fucking hilarious

2016-06-15 10:19:14	theholyduck	when i cashed them in in 10 years. i would have lost money
2016-06-15 10:19:25	theholyduck	because inflation would lose me more value than the return on the bond
2016-06-15 10:19:31	crutchy	dude, that doesn't make it better for germany lol

2016-06-15 10:19:39	theholyduck	the return on german 10 year bonds is 0% right now.
2016-06-15 10:19:59	theholyduck	crutchy: sure it does. because it means germany is paying less in intrest on the bonds. than the bonds will devaluate each year
2016-06-15 10:20:03	theholyduck	making them earn money on it.
2016-06-15 10:20:21	theholyduck	crutchy: the return being 0% means that germany is paying literally 0% intrest to loan money for 10 years
2016-06-15 10:20:28	crutchy	so you tank your economy just to inflate your debt away... yeah great idea
2016-06-15 10:20:39	theholyduck	crutchy: no need to tank your economy either
2016-06-15 10:20:47	theholyduck	as long as the economy keeps growing its fine.

2016-06-15 10:23:33	luke-jr	crutchy: charity is the only point of lending
2016-06-15 10:23:42	theholyduck	people have a complete belief that germany will repay they bonds.
2016-06-15 10:23:50	crutchy	is that why the church lends everyone heaps of money?
2016-06-15 10:24:00	theholyduck	so if they put their money in german bonds they might lose a little bit of money. but they wont lose it all
2016-06-15 10:24:06	crutchy	theholyduck, "people" are in for a rude shock
2016-06-15 10:24:14	luke-jr	crutchy: the church usually just gives it

2016-06-15 10:45:00	aoseki	theholyduck, why your case is stupid is because the value of the euro is influenced by the value of gold and not the other way around
2016-06-15 10:45:05	crutchy	actually it depends on who owns the asteroid
2016-06-15 10:45:07	theholyduck	crutchy: ok. so the default is a function of the value decreasing. not just a intrinsic value of fiat currency
2016-06-15 10:45:10	theholyduck	that doesnt apply to anything else
2016-06-15 10:45:19	theholyduck	aoseki: these are 2 seperate scenarios
2016-06-15 10:45:22	crutchy	fiat currency only has value if you can use it to buy stuff
2016-06-15 10:45:24	aoseki	theholyduck, i.e the euro can lose value affected by the economy and gold supply and reserves, but an excess of euro will do shit to gold's value
2016-06-15 10:45:28	theholyduck	read up to my orginal point. 
2016-06-15 10:45:40	aoseki	scroll up that much?
2016-06-15 10:45:40	theholyduck	aoseki:  im not saying these 2 events happen in the same universe
2016-06-15 10:45:58	aoseki	well
2016-06-15 10:46:02	vash	assets are not currency
2016-06-15 10:46:05	vash	/thread
2016-06-15 10:46:08	theholyduck	<crutchy> paying off debt with something that's worth less is default dude
2016-06-15 10:46:14	aoseki	vash, which i've been saying for like 15 minutes ><
2016-06-15 10:46:20	crutchy	theholyduck, yeah
2016-06-15 10:46:31	theholyduck	i then brought up the scenario of what if gold was worth less
2016-06-15 10:46:36	theholyduck	and you kept saying that wasnt default
2016-06-15 10:46:44	crutchy	then those with debt in gold might default
2016-06-15 10:46:52	◣	Felishia (~dev@unaffiliated/felishia) has quit (Quit: Leaving)
2016-06-15 10:47:05	theholyduck	now that i finally made you understand what you are saying. we both agree. 
2016-06-15 10:47:06	aoseki	1. a gold asteroid of sufficient size to actually affect economies world-wide hitting the earth would be a catastrophic event (possibly end-of-life event)
2016-06-15 10:47:13	crutchy	i'm not saying its impossible to default on a gold debt
2016-06-15 10:47:19	crutchy	just very unlikely
2016-06-15 10:47:36	crutchy	your 100 bars are just as likely to be worth the same in 10 years
2016-06-15 10:47:37	aoseki	i still fail to see the point of this conversation
2016-06-15 10:47:48	aoseki	the entire system is a convention 
2016-06-15 10:48:07	crutchy	me too. this stuff should be pretty obvious
2016-06-15 10:48:10	theholyduck	theholyduck> when i lent you 100 gold bars and you paid me back 100 gold bars
2016-06-15 10:48:10	theholyduck	10:32:56 C<crutchy> theholyduck, that's not default
2016-06-15 10:48:27	vash	the point of this conversation is that reality is as it is, and you are arguing about how you each perceive it
2016-06-15 10:48:28	crutchy	dude, there's no gold asteroid
2016-06-15 10:48:33	vash	in other words
2016-06-15 10:48:35	vash	semantics
2016-06-15 10:48:35	theholyduck	crutchy:  like i had allready stippulated several times in this argument
2016-06-15 10:48:38	theholyduck	that for whatever reason
2016-06-15 10:48:44	theholyduck	gold had lost 10% of its value
2016-06-15 10:48:49	theholyduck	and you kept insisting its not default
2016-06-15 10:48:53	crutchy	if you wanna live in your thought experiment, that's fine
2016-06-15 10:49:04	crutchy	when you wanna talk about reality, i'm your man
2016-06-15 10:49:20	theholyduck	crutchy: i just wanted to get on the same page as you. you have a very strict and pedantic definitino of default
2016-06-15 10:49:24	crutchy	i have nfi what the rules are in your imagination
2016-06-15 10:49:45	crutchy	i have the same definition as any bank
2016-06-15 10:50:00	theholyduck	crutchy: well basicly by your definiton. every time the us repays one of its 2-3 year bonds at this point.
2016-06-15 10:50:04	theholyduck	they are defaulting on their debt
2016-06-15 10:50:10	aoseki	vash, theholyduck basically dragged us into a moron conversation where 100 euros (who obtain value from the EU going "because I say so", otherwise they're worth their base materials), with a base material which obtains value from being a base material
2016-06-15 10:50:11	crutchy	no
2016-06-15 10:50:17	theholyduck	because they paid less in intrest on it than the value of the currency fell
2016-06-15 10:50:27	aoseki	were compared*
2016-06-15 10:50:45	theholyduck	crutchy: how is that not a default by the conditions you just set?
2016-06-15 10:50:57	theholyduck	crutchy: the people who lent the us money in 2014 for a 2 year bond
2016-06-15 10:50:57	vash	it's simple, gold is an asset, euros are currency
2016-06-15 10:51:02	theholyduck	is getting lessvalue back 
2016-06-15 10:51:06	theholyduck	than they put in
2016-06-15 10:51:10	aoseki	theholyduck, if you borrow 100 gold bars now and get 100 gold bars later, when gold is worth 10% less, you still have 100 gold bars
2016-06-15 10:51:15	crutchy	erm. interest and principal are different
2016-06-15 10:51:19	aoseki	theholyduck, with euro, you have paper
2016-06-15 10:51:21	rr-	can anime figures become currency?
2016-06-15 10:51:30	crutchy	the debt is the principal
2016-06-15 10:51:34	aoseki	no
2016-06-15 10:51:43	theholyduck	crutchy: so why did you consider my previous example a default at ALL?
2016-06-15 10:51:47	aoseki	vash, I give up
2016-06-15 10:51:57	crutchy	theholyduck, cos you were talking about debt

2016-06-15 10:53:59	theholyduck	crutchy: like if i bought a 2 year bond in 2014 i would get about 0.3% intrest on it
2016-06-15 10:54:18	theholyduck	so today if i got my money back. i could buy less shit with that
2016-06-15 10:54:24	theholyduck	then i could when i bought that bond in 2014
2016-06-15 10:54:57	crutchy	why would anyone lend money at that?
2016-06-15 10:55:02	theholyduck	crutchy: tons of people did :P
2016-06-15 10:55:10	theholyduck	for a variety of reason

2016-06-15 10:55:55	crutchy	when was it not?

2016-04-29 11:23:11	Sinex	Short question :) i've switched to BSPWM some time ago (and love it <3)  and i'm now encountering some wireless problems - it seems i can only connect to the WLan of my university (eduroam) if I start a GNOME session first.. I start the nm-applet in my bspwmrc file and it works without any problems at home.. Somebody got some idea what the problem could be?

2016-05-20 14:36:33	Sinex	hi :) 
2016-05-20 14:38:22	Sinex	Short question - is there any way to get MATLAB running with bspwm? I'm using openjdk-8 and tried to set the _JAVA_AWT_WM_NONREPARENTING environment variable but nothing works so far :/ 
2016-05-20 14:40:04	blind	I've had lots of issues with java apps running under bspwm :\
2016-05-20 14:40:58	Sinex	Meh, that's too bad :\
2016-05-20 14:49:43	Sinex	anybody else got some ideas?

2016-05-20 15:55:20	Sinex	mhh, didn't work - could it be that the wm_name option was removed? I don't see it in autocomplete and when i run it from shell it returns an errorcode
2016-05-20 15:55:45	blind	eh if I try bspwm again... I moved back to fluxbox for the time being :p
2016-05-20 15:56:07	Sinex	Oh, maybe i should install wmname...
2016-05-20 15:56:58	Sinex	IT WORKS
2016-05-20 15:57:01	Sinex	i love you
2016-05-20 15:57:08	anthony25	oh, maybe it was removed in bspwm 0.9.1
2016-05-20 15:57:14	anthony25	so what did you do ?
2016-05-20 15:57:42	anthony25	just "wmname LG3D"?
2016-05-20 15:58:30	Sinex	yep
2016-05-20 15:58:46	blind	good to know.
2016-05-20 15:58:52	Sinex	indeed
2016-05-20 15:59:01	Sinex	finally, no more switching to xfce just for matlab
2016-05-20 15:59:02	Sinex	<3
2016-05-20 16:01:46	anthony25	you're welcome ;)
2016-05-20 16:06:15	Sinex	I just recently (<= 3 month) switched to linux and I have to admit I'm really glad that I did.. :D I really like my current setup, even though I still have very very very much to learn :D 
2016-05-20 16:07:07	anthony25	oh, starting with bspwm after 3 months is pretty cool
2016-05-20 16:07:46	anthony25	I mean that I stayed a lot more times under gnome, in part because it did a lot of stuff for me :p
2016-05-20 16:08:17	anthony25	and because I liked the useless 3d effects :D
2016-05-20 16:09:59	anthony25	but I'm on arch for several years now
2016-05-20 16:10:26	Sinex	Haha :D I started with ApricityOS which has gnome installed by default but I wanted to try install the system "from scratch"
2016-05-20 16:10:40	Sinex	then installed arch with gnome
2016-05-20 16:10:44	Sinex	then switched to i3
2016-05-20 16:11:13	Sinex	after finding /r/unixporn :D 
2016-05-20 16:11:24	anthony25	I see ;)
2016-05-20 16:11:25	Sinex	then switched to herbstluft and god knows what else
2016-05-20 16:11:26	Sinex	:D 
2016-05-20 16:11:40	blind	I've been using fluxbox for a long time :p
2016-05-20 16:11:52	Sinex	I wanted to try fluxbox too :D 
2016-05-20 16:11:58	blind	tried out other WMs/DEs here and there, but bspwm was the first one that kept me for more than a few days
2016-05-20 16:12:00	anthony25	switching on something I could not pronounce was not an option for me :DDD
2016-05-20 16:12:27	Sinex	haha, i'm from austria so that was no problem :D 
2016-05-20 16:15:09	anthony25	yeah, I'm french, so herbstluft sounds like a sneeze to me
2016-05-20 16:15:30	Sinex	and herbstluftwm was pretty cool, but mainly because i found a script which changes the colorscheme according to the background image
2016-05-20 16:15:41	anthony25	oh
2016-05-20 16:16:18	anthony25	actually iirc you can do this quite easily in bspwm too
2016-05-20 16:16:19	Sinex	Which i still want in bspwm and which i'm pretty sure is possible, but i don't want to invest too much energy now ;D 
2016-05-20 16:16:38	Sinex	hahah yeah :D 
2016-05-20 16:16:46	anthony25	but I don't remember if your can change on-the-fly the borders
2016-05-20 16:17:11	anthony25	I mean for an already opened window
2016-05-20 16:17:32	blind	you can, but you have to specify the window ID

2016-05-20 16:57:44	blind	you have to set margin on the other desktop
